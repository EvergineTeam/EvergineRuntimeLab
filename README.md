# Evergine Runtime Lab

This Evergine sample demonstrates the Runtime Loaders that allows loading multiple file formats at runtime.

The application works as a laboratory environment where you can easily test Evergineâ€™s runtime capabilities by dragging and dropping files directly into the window. The supported file types are automatically recognized and visualized in real time.

### Supported Formats

- **3D Models:**  
`.glb`, `.obj`, `.stl`, `.usdz`

- **CAD Files:**  
`.ifc`, `.dxf`, `.dwg`

- **Images:**  
`.bmp`, `.gif`, `.ico`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.ktx`, `.ktx2`, `.png`, `.webp`
